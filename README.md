# Mini Message Board

_Updated as part of the The Odin Project's major NodeJS curriculum update_.

Developed as part of [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-mini-message-board), this project provided me with a short introduction to developing an Express application.

- **Live Preview:** [Deployed Using Railway](https://mini-message-board-production-839b.up.railway.app/)

## Learning Outcomes

- **Express**

  - Gained a base knowledge of core Express concepts such as middleware, routes, and the MVC pattern.
  - Learned basic `EJS` rendering engine syntax and capabilities.

- **Database**
  - Integrated a Postgresql database using the [`node-postgres (pg)`](https://node-postgres.com/) library.
    - Setup a local postgres installation and configured a local database.
    - Created a basic `messages` table and initialization script.
    - Implemented simple SQL queries to interact with the database.

## Challenges

The main challenge I faced was implementing, structuring, and deploying a locally developed Postgresql database.

- Structuring and organizing the database modules (queries, connection management, etc.)
- Deploying the database to Railway.
  - Previously TOP taught MongodDB which offered a more straightforward development and deployment process through MongoDB Atlas. Adjusting the nuances of Postgresql and Railway was a very valuable learning experience.
